üßæ Booking Management System

A small console-based Java application to create, list, and cancel bookings. It includes conflict validation (no double bookings for the same resource/time slot), a simple in-memory database (H2), and optional CSV export.

This project was built to practice backend development concepts such as JDBC, DAO pattern, and layered architecture (MVC) using Maven and JUnit 5.

üß† Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world booking backend in a simple way:

Users can create, list, or cancel bookings.

The system prevents overlapping reservations.

All data is stored in an H2 in-memory database (initialized automatically on startup).

You can export bookings to CSV for reporting.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Option 1 ‚Äî From Maven
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java

Option 2 ‚Äî From the JAR file
After building, go to /target and run:
java -jar booking-management-system-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Or on Windows, just double-click:
run-booking-app.bat

üíæ Database

The project uses an H2 in-memory database that initializes automatically on startup.

schema.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookings (
id IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
user_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
resource VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX idx_resource_time ON bookings(resource, start_time, end_time);

You can change the connection string in DbConnection.java if you want to persist data:
jdbc:h2:./data/bookings

üß™ Testing

Run all unit tests with:
mvn test

Main tests included:

Create booking successfully

Detect overlapping booking conflicts

Cancel and list bookings correctly

üß© Design Notes

This project follows a simple layered structure:

Layer	Responsibility
Model	Represents data (Booking.java)
DAO	Handles database operations via JDBC
Service	Business logic (conflict validation, rules)
App (CLI)	User interaction (console menu)

Errors are handled gracefully ‚Äî the app shows clear messages instead of stack traces.

üì§ CSV Export

Bookings can be exported to a file named bookings_export.csv in the working directory. Use the Export option in the menu or call CsvExporter.export() manually.

ü™™ Example Run

=== Booking Management System ===

Create 2) List 3) Cancel 4) Export CSV 0) Exit

1
User: alice
Resource: room-101
Start (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm): 2025-10-26 10:00
End (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm): 2025-10-26 11:00
Created: Booking{id=1, user=alice, res=room-101, 2025-10-26T10:00 -> 2025-10-26T11:00}

üß≠ Future Improvements

Add support for multiple resources or booking categories

Build a small Swing or web interface

Store data in a persistent file (H2 file mode or SQLite)

Add email or notification simulation for new bookings
